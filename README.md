# POGA: Prompt Optimization for Generative AI

**POGA** is a framework for optimizing prompts used with generative AI models. It provides tools and methodologies to systematically improve prompt effectiveness, quality, and reliability across various AI applications.

---

## Overview

Prompt engineering is critical for getting the best results from generative AI models. POGA aims to:

- **Automate prompt optimization** through systematic testing and iteration
- **Measure prompt performance** using quantitative metrics
- **Share best practices** for prompt design across different use cases
- **Enable reproducible experiments** for prompt evaluation

## Getting Started

```bash
# Installation (coming soon)
pip install poga

# Basic usage example
from poga import PromptOptimizer

optimizer = PromptOptimizer(
    model="gpt-4",
    task_type="content_generation"
)

optimized_prompt = optimizer.optimize(
    base_prompt="Write a blog post about...",
    evaluation_criteria=["clarity", "engagement", "accuracy"]
)
```
